# hadoop

Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework written in Java for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware.

This LXC container provides basic hardoop functionality for the HARTING MICA computing appliance. It is intended for experimentation and development, but should not be used for production.
